* Story number and name:  3 - Visibility control on photos
* Story points:  4
* Brief description to see the story in action:
* Choose a photo and click the upload button. Answer the prompt â€” clicking cancel on the shareable list shares the photo with everyone. Clicking Ok leads you to a text box and an Add User and Complete Upload Pic button. Type the full name of users you would like to share with (case sensitive) in the text box, click add user, and then click complete upload pic. Then you can log out and log into the specified users to see the semiprivate photo.

Clicking Complete Upload Pic without typing any users/not pressing Add User causes the photo to only be viewable by the user who uploaded it.
